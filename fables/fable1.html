<h1>The Dog &amp; the Shadow</h1>
<p>
It happened that a Dog had got a piece of meat and was carrying it home in his mouth to eat it in peace.
</p>
<p>
Now on his way home he had to cross a plank lying across a running brook.
</p>
<p>
As he crossed, he looked down and saw his own shadow reflected in the water beneath.
</p>
<p>
Thinking it was another dog with another piece of meat, he made up his mind to have that also.
</p>
<p>
So he made a snap at the shadow in the water, but as he opened his mouth the piece of meat fell out, dropped into the water and was never seen more.
